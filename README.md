# GESTURE-RECOGNITION-SYSTEM-PROJECT---CODECLAUSE---AI-ENGINEERING
I developed a Gesture Recognition System using a CNN to interpret sign language gestures. The project involved data loading, preprocessing, EDA, and building a CNN model. After training for 50 epochs, the model achieved a test accuracy of 95.02%. It also supports real-time gesture prediction using a webcam for practical use.
